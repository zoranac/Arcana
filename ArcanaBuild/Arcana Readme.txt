Welcome to Arcana! Here's how to play:

This game is built for use with the Xbox 360 Controller

In menus, use the D-PAD or LEFT STICK to select upwards and downwards.
Use the A BUTTON to make selections.

While in the game world, you can move with the LEFT STICK and interact with
NPCs using the A BUTTON


While in the town, you can take money off the body of your last character by
going to the FUNERAL HOME and pressing the A BUTTON next to the coffin

You can use this money to buy new runes and upgrade your magic at the shop



While in the dungeon, you can access your spellbook through the pause menu
With the START BUTTON. From your spellbook, you can select a shape rune
and an element rune for each of your 4 spell slots.

Using the corresponding TRIGGER BUTTON, you can select between the spells
made with your spellbook!

When the pink special bar at the bottom of the screen is full and turns yellow
Pull all 4 TRIGGER BUTTONS simultaneously to begin a minigame. Wait for the 
minigame to give you a series of inputs, and then repeat them back! If you
succeed, all present enemies will be destroyed, and the black hole to the
next area will open!
